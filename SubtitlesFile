Atlas
0:13
Shrugged this is a novel by Ein
0:16
Rand and it's probably one of the most
0:19
important novels ever
0:20
written um I'm just now getting through
0:23
this book an audio book for and I
0:26
recently stumbled across What's called
0:27
the money
0:28
speech and I think it is one of the best
0:33
descriptions of money I have ever heard
0:36
so I thought it would be useful for me
0:38
to come on the show today and just read
0:40
it in at full it's about a 15minute
0:44
speech roughly five pages in the book in
0:46
this version of Atlas Shrug is between
0:48
Pages 410 and 415 it's a fiction novel
0:52
there's a conversation going on between
0:54
a few of the
0:55
characters and uh I'm just going to jump
0:57
into this it's out of context but this
1:00
is a long di tribe by one of the main
1:02
characters named Francisco Dan conia and
1:06
so I'm going to jump into this right now
1:09
and um I hope you guys
1:13
enjoy so you think that money is the
1:15
root of all evil said Francisco Dan
1:18
conia have you ever asked what is the
1:21
root of money money is a tool of
1:23
exchange which can't exist unless there
1:26
are Goods produced and Men able to
1:28
produce them
1:30
money is the material shape of the
1:32
principle that men who wish to deal with
1:34
one another must deal by trade and give
1:37
value or
1:40
value money is not the tool of the
1:42
muchers who claim your product by Tears
1:46
or of the looters who take it from you
1:48
by
1:49
force money is made possible only by the
1:52
men who
1:53
produce is this what you consider
1:57
evil when you accept money and payment
2:00
for your effort you do so only on the
2:02
conviction that you will exchange it for
2:04
the product of the effort of
2:06
others it is not the Moochers or the
2:09
looters give value to money not an ocean
2:12
of Tears nor all the guns in the world
2:15
can transform those pieces of paper in
2:17
your wallet into the bread you will need
2:19
to survive
2:21
tomorrow those pieces of paper which
2:24
should have been gold are a token of
2:27
honor your claim upon the energy of the
2:29
men who
2:31
produce your wallet is your statement of
2:34
hope that somewhere in the world around
2:36
you there are men who will not default
2:39
on that moral principle which is the
2:41
root of money is this what you consider
2:46
evil have you ever looked for the root
2:48
of
2:49
production take a look at an electric
2:52
generator and dare tell yourself that it
2:54
was created by the muscular effort of
2:56
unthinking
2:57
brutes try to grow a seed of wheat
3:00
without the knowledge Left To You by men
3:02
who had to Discover It For the First
3:05
Time Try to obtain your food by means of
3:08
nothing but physical motions and you'll
3:10
learn that man's mind is the root of all
3:13
the goods produced and of all the wealth
3:15
that has ever existed on Earth but you
3:18
say that money is made by the strong at
3:20
the expense of the
3:22
weak what strength do you
3:25
mean it is not the strength of guns or
3:28
muscles wealth is the product of a man's
3:31
capacity to
3:33
think then is money made by the man who
3:36
invents a motor at the expense of those
3:38
who did not invent it is money made by
3:42
the intelligent at the expense of the
3:44
fools by the able at the expense of the
3:48
incompetent by the ambitious at the
3:50
expense of the
3:51
lazy money is made before it can be
3:54
looted or mooched made by the effort of
3:57
every honest man each to the extent of
4:00
his
4:01
ability an honest man is one who knows
4:04
that he can't consume more than he has
4:09
produced to trade by means of money is
4:12
the code of the men of Goodwill money
4:15
rests on the axom that every man is the
4:17
owner of his mind and his
4:19
effort money allows no power to
4:22
prescribe the value of your effort
4:23
except the voluntary choice of the man
4:26
who is willing to trade you his effort
4:28
in return
4:31
money permits you to obtain for your
4:32
goods and your labor that which they are
4:34
worth to the men who buy them but no
4:37
more money permits no deals except those
4:41
to Mutual benefit by the unforced
4:43
Judgment of the
4:45
Traders money demands of you the
4:48
recognition that men must work for their
4:50
own benefit not for their own injury or
4:53
their gain not their loss the
4:56
recognition that they are not beasts of
4:58
Burden born to carry the weight of your
5:01
misery that you must offer them values
5:04
not wounds that the common Bond among
5:07
men is not the exchange of suffering but
5:10
the exchange of
5:12
goods money demands that you sell not
5:15
your weakness to men's stupidity but
5:17
your talent to their
5:19
reason it demands that you buy not the
5:22
shoddiest they offer but the best your
5:25
money can
5:26
find and when men live by trade with
5:30
reason not force as their final Arbiter
5:33
it is the best product that wins the
5:36
best
5:37
performance the man of the best judgment
5:39
and highest
5:41
ability and the degree of a man's
5:43
productiveness is the degree of his
5:46
reward this is the code of existence
5:49
whose tool and symbol is
5:52
money is this which you consider
5:57
evil but money is only a tool
6:00
it will take you wherever you wish but
6:02
it will not replace you as the
6:05
driver it will give you the means for
6:07
the satisfaction of your desires but it
6:09
will not provide you with
6:16
[Music]
6:18
desires money is the scorge of The Men
6:21
Who attempt to reverse the law of
6:24
causality the men who seek to replace
6:27
the Mind by seizing the product of the
6:30
Mind money will not purchase happiness
6:33
for the man who has no concept of what
6:35
he wants money will not give him a code
6:37
of values if he's evaded the knowledge
6:40
of what to value and it will not provide
6:43
him with a purpose if he's evaded the
6:45
choice of what to
6:47
seek money will not buy intelligence for
6:49
the fool or admiration for the coward or
6:53
respect for the
6:55
incompetent the man who attempts to
6:57
purchase the brains of his superiors to
6:59
serve him with his money replacing his
7:01
judgment ends up by becoming the victim
7:04
of his
7:06
inferiors the men of intelligence desert
7:09
him but the cheats and the frauds come
7:11
flocking to him drawn by a law which he
7:14
has not discovered that no man may be
7:17
smaller than his
7:19
money is this the reason why you call it
7:26
evil only the man who does not need it
7:29
is fit to inherit wealth the man who
7:32
would make his own fortune no matter
7:34
where he
7:35
started if an heir is equal to his money
7:38
it serves him if not it destroys
7:42
him but you look on and you cry that
7:44
money corrupted him did it or did he
7:48
corrupt his
7:49
money do not envy a worthless Heir his
7:52
wealth is not yours and you would have
7:55
done no better with it do not think that
7:58
it should have been d distributed among
8:00
you loading the world with 50 parasites
8:03
instead of one would not bring back the
8:06
dead virtue that was the
8:09
fortune money is a living power that
8:12
dies without its
8:14
root money will not serve the mind that
8:17
cannot match it is this the reason why
8:20
you call it
8:24
evil money is your means of survival the
8:28
verdict you pronounce upon the source of
8:29
your livelihood is the verdict you
8:31
pronounce upon your
8:33
life if the source is corrupt you have
8:36
damned your own
8:38
existence did you get your money by
8:41
fraud by pandering to men's vices or
8:43
men's
8:45
stupidity by catering to fools in the
8:48
hope of getting more than your ability
8:50
deserves by lowering your standards by
8:54
doing work you despise for purchasers
8:57
you
8:58
scorn if if so then your money will not
9:01
give you a moment's or a Penny's worth
9:03
of
9:04
Joy then all the things you buy will
9:07
become not a tribute to you but a
9:10
reproach not an achievement but a
9:12
reminder of
9:14
Shame then you'll scream that money is
9:17
evil evil because it would not pinch hit
9:20
for your
9:22
self-respect evil because it would not
9:24
let you enjoy your
9:27
depravity is this the root of your
9:30
hatred of
9:32
money money will always remain an effect
9:35
and refuse to replace you as the
9:38
cause money is the product of virtue but
9:41
it will not give you virtue and it will
9:43
not redeem your
9:46
vices money will not give you the
9:48
unearned neither in matter nor in spirit
9:52
is this the root of your hatred of
9:58
money
9:59
[Music]
10:01
or do you say it's the love of money
10:04
that's the root of all evil to love a
10:07
thing is to know and love its nature to
10:10
love money is to know and love the fact
10:12
that money is the creation of the best
10:14
power within you and your pass key to
10:17
trade your effort for the effort of the
10:19
best among
10:21
men it's the person who would sell his
10:24
soul for a nickel who is loudest in
10:26
proclaiming his hatred of money
10:29
and he has good reason to hate it the
10:32
lovers of money are willing to work for
10:34
it they know they are able to deserve
10:38
it let me give you a tip on a clue to
10:41
men's
10:45
characters the man who dams money has
10:48
obtained it
10:49
dishonorably the man who respects it has
10:51
earned
10:52
it run for your life from any man who
10:56
tells you that money is evil that
10:58
sentence is the lepers Bell of an
11:00
approaching
11:01
looter so long as men live together on
11:04
Earth and need means to deal with one
11:06
another their only substitute if they
11:09
abandon money is the muzzle of a
11:12
gun but money demands of you the highest
11:16
virtues if you wish to make it or to
11:18
keep
11:20
it men who have no courage Pride or
11:24
self-esteem men who have no moral sense
11:26
of their right to their money and are
11:29
not willing to defend it as they defend
11:31
their life men who apologize for being
11:34
rich will not remain Rich for
11:37
long they are the natural bait for the
11:40
Swarms of looters that stand under rocks
11:42
for centuries but come crawling out at
11:45
the first smell of a man who begs to be
11:47
forgiven for the guilt of owning
11:50
wealth they will hasten to relieve him
11:53
of the guilt and of his life as he
11:57
deserves then you will see the rise of
11:59
the men of the double standard The Men
12:02
Who live by force yet count on those who
12:05
live by trade to create the value of
12:07
their looted
12:08
money the men who are The Hitchhikers of
12:12
virtue in a moral Society these are the
12:14
criminals and the statutes are written
12:17
to protect you against
12:19
them but when a society establishes
12:21
criminals by right and looters by law
12:25
men who use Force to seize the wealth of
12:28
disarm armed victims then money becomes
12:31
its Creator's
12:33
Avenger such looters believe it safe to
12:36
Rob defenseless men once they've passed
12:39
the law to disarm
12:41
them but their loot becomes the magnet
12:43
for other looters who get it from them
12:46
as they got it then the race goes not to
12:50
the ablest at production but to those
12:53
most ruthless at
12:55
brutality when force is the standard the
12:58
murder murer wins over the pickpocket
13:01
and then that Society vanishes in a
13:03
spread of ruins and
13:07
Slaughter do you wish to know whether
13:09
that day is coming watch
13:11
money money is the barometer of a
13:14
society's
13:15
virtue when you see that trading is done
13:18
not by consent but by
13:20
compulsion and you see that in order to
13:23
produce you need to obtain permission
13:25
from men who produce nothing when you
13:28
see that money is Flowing to those who
13:31
deal not in Goods but in
13:34
favors when you see that men get richer
13:37
by graft and by pull than by work and
13:40
your laws don't protect you against them
13:43
but protect them against you you see
13:46
corruption being rewarded and honesty
13:48
becoming a
13:50
self-sacrifice you may know that your
13:52
Society is
13:57
doomed
14:01
[Music]
14:04
money is so Noble a medium that it does
14:07
not compete with guns and it does not
14:10
make terms with
14:12
brutality it will not permit a country
14:14
to survive as half property half
14:21
loot whenever destroyers appear among
14:24
men they start by destroying money for
14:26
money is men's protection and the base a
14:28
moral
14:33
existence destroyers seize gold and
14:36
leave to its owners a counterfeit pile
14:38
of
14:39
paper this kills all objective standards
14:42
and delivers men into the arbitrary
14:44
power of an arbitrary Setter of
14:47
values gold was an objective value an
14:51
equivalent of wealth
14:52
produced paper is a mortgage on wealth
14:55
that does not exist backed by a gun
14:58
aimed at those who are expected to
15:01
produce
15:02
it paper is a check drawn by legal
15:05
looters upon an account which is not
15:08
theirs upon the virtue of the
15:11
victims watch for the day when it
15:14
bounces marked account
15:18
overdrawn when you have made evil the
15:21
means of survival do not expect men to
15:24
remain
15:25
good do not expect them to stay moral
15:29
and lose their lives for the purpose of
15:31
becoming the fodder of the
15:33
immoral do not expect them to produce
15:37
when production is punished and looting
15:40
rewarded do not ask who is destroying
15:43
the world you
15:48
[Music]
15:57
are
16:00
you stand in the midst of the greatest
16:02
achievements of the greatest productive
16:05
civilization and you wonder why it's
16:07
crumbling around you while you're
16:09
damning its lifeblood
16:12
money you look upon money as the Savages
16:15
did before you and you wonder why the
16:17
jungle is creeping back to the edge of
16:19
your
16:21
cities throughout men's history money
16:24
was always seized by looters of one
16:26
brand or another whose names changed but
16:29
whose method remained the
16:31
same to seize wealth by force to keep
16:34
the producers bound demean defamed
16:38
deprived of
16:40
Honor that phrase about the evil of
16:42
money which you mouth with such
16:45
righteous
16:46
recklessness comes from a time when
16:48
wealth was produced by the labor of
16:51
slaves slaves who repeated the Motions
16:54
once discovered by somebody's mind and
16:57
left unimproved for
17:00
centuries so long as production was
17:02
ruled by force and wealth was obtained
17:05
by Conquest there was little to
17:08
conquer yet through all the centuries of
17:10
stagnation and starvation men exalted
17:13
the
17:13
looters as Aristocrats of the sword as
17:17
Aristocrats of birth as Aristocrats of
17:20
the bureau and despise The Producers as
17:24
slaves as Traders as shopkeepers as
17:30
[Music]
17:37
industrialist to the glory of mankind
17:40
there was for the first and only time in
17:42
history a country of money and I have no
17:46
higher more reverent tribute to pay to
17:49
America for this
17:51
means a country of Reason Justice
17:55
Freedom production achievement
17:59
for the first time man's mind and money
18:01
were set free and there were no fortunes
18:04
by Conquest but only fortunes by work
18:08
and instead of Swordsmen and slaves
18:11
there appeared the real maker of wealth
18:14
the greatest worker the highest type of
18:16
human
18:19
being for the first time man's mind and
18:22
money were set free and there were no
18:25
fortunes by Conquest but only fortunes
18:28
by work and instead of Swordsmen and
18:31
slaves there appeared the real maker of
18:34
wealth the greatest worker the highest
18:37
type of human being the self-made man
18:41
the American
18:43
industrialist if you ask me to name the
18:45
proudest distinction of Americans I
18:48
would choose because it contains all the
18:50
others the fact that they were the
18:53
people who created the phrase to make
18:57
money no other language or Nation had
19:00
ever used these words before men had
19:03
always thought of wealth as a static
19:05
quantity to be seized begged inherited
19:09
shared looted or obtained as a
19:13
favor Americans were the first to
19:15
understand that wealth has to be
19:18
created the words to make money hold the
19:21
essence of human
19:24
morality yet these were the words for
19:26
which Americans were denounced by the
19:28
rotted cultures of the lutters
19:31
continents Now The lutters Credo has
19:34
brought you to regard your proudest
19:37
achievements as a Hallmark of Shame your
19:39
Prosperity as guilt your greatest men
19:42
the industrialists as black guards and
19:45
your magnificent factories as the
19:47
product and property of muscular
19:50
labor the labor of whip driven slaves
19:54
like the pyramids of
19:56
Egypt the Roder who simpers that he sees
19:59
no difference between the power of the
20:01
dollar and the power of the whip ought
20:03
to learn the difference on his own hide
20:06
as I think he
20:09
[Music]
20:13
will until and unless you discover that
20:16
money is the root of all good you ask
20:19
for your own
20:21
destruction when money ceases to be the
20:23
tool by which men deal with one another
20:26
then men become the tool tools of men
20:30
blood whips and guns or dollars take
20:34
your
20:35
choice there is no other and your time
20:38
is running
20:40
